# kOS-Scripts
kerbal Operating System Scripts

A collection of my personal used Kerbal Space Program (KSP) - kerbal Operating System (kOS) scripts.
Most scripts are either altered scripts and or copy/pasted together to make more complete scripts.

Original script sources/authors can be found in the scripts.

Currently scripts are KSP 1.9.1 and kOS 1.2.1.0 compatible.

Script can be installed into /Kerbal Space Program/Ships/Script/
